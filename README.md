[Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". It is a global community of sharing information not only for individual users but also for businesses aiming to increase their brand awareness, boost sales, partner up with influencers, and manage reputation. With the advent of artificial intelligence, businesses are now able to perform sentiment analyis, keeping track of what is being said about their product and detect negative mentions before they become major issues. 

[BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) is a machine learning technique for natural language processing developed by Google. It is known for its multidirectional feedback system and complicated structure. 

## Abstract

The project identifies the reason why BERT is a powerful tool for sentimental analysis. By comparing BERT with two baseline models (traditional CNN and BiLSTM), it is concluded that BERT is a powerful neural network for gathering subjectinve information from text. The area of its application is endless.
